# team-profile-generator

## Description
- The goal of this project was to create a team profile generator that accepts inputs in the terminal for team members, then outputs those results into a populated HTML page, as well as provide test checks

- I built this project in order to better understand how to use the express, inquire, and node to have dynamic inputs with the terminal, and how to populate those on a web page

- What I learned on this project is how to properly link different external classes into a main page

## Installation
To install this project, you need to:
-Download the code from the projects GitHub: https://github.com/flammtaro/team-profile-generator
-Open the code in Visual Studio Code

## Usage
This code contains an index.js file that runs the program. To do so, you open your terminal, and type node index.js. Then, a series of prompts will appear that will ask you questions. After you are finished, the index.html will be generated, and your webpage can be viewed in your browser. A video of the current version of the program can be seen here: [![Press to Play Video](https://i.imgur.com/P2MnyKn.png)](https://youtu.be/M7W7UVwJkac).
